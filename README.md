This project dives into how her concerts affect Airbnb revenue, **particularly for hosts looking to optimize their pricing strategies.**

## Objective

## Motivation

This project idea was born when **I was helping a relative set up their Airbnb Host account**. With everyone talking about the Eras Tour, **I got curious** about how Taylor Swift's presence could boost Airbnb revenue for my relative.

## Audience

This project is for Airbnb Hosts who want to understand how major events, like Taylor Swift concerts, can impact their pricing strategies and revenue. The insights here can help you adjust your prices to make the most of these events.

## Methodology

- **Data Collection:**
  * The primary dataset is the Airbnb listings in Los Angeles, updated last in September 2023, relevant for our study surrounding Swift's August 2023 concerts.
  *  The dataset is available at [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/).
- **Analysis:** We establish a baseline of prices and we compare concert dates versus non-concert dates to see the impact across different neighborhoods
- **Conclusion**: Airbnb hosts can significantly benefit from Swift's concerts by adjusting their pricing strategies. The study suggests a middle-range pricing model during concert dates to maximize bookings.

## Further Research (expand study)
- **Transportation Trends**: Examining transportation usage during concert dates could offer additional insights.
- **Cross-City Analysis**: Comparing data across different cities where Swift performs could help optimize pricing strategies for hosts with properties in multiple locations.
- **Restaurant Data**: Incorporating restaurant review data could provide a fuller picture of economic impacts during concert dates.

## Limitations
The main limitation is the availability of relevant data for comprehensive analysis across different locations and sectors.
