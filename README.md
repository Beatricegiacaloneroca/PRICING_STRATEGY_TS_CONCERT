Multiple studies have already covered the general impact that Taylor Swift has on the economy of a country when she performs a concert. 
However, few focus on her impact on specific businesses. 
This project dives into how her concerts affect Airbnb revenue, **particularly for hosts looking to optimize their pricing strategies.** 


### Objective

### Audience

This project is for Airbnb Hosts who want to understand how major events, like Taylor Swift concerts, can impact their pricing strategies and revenue. The insights here can help you adjust your prices to make the most of these events.

3. **Neighborhood Popularity**: ***Do TS fans look for luxury listings?***
      * We notice that there is no strong direct relationship between the price of the listing and the number of bookings
      * However, we observe that the most popular behavior is to get medium priced listings
      * This is expected as considering the audience of the concert, they are not business travelers, thus they are not after the most expensive listings

#### - **Conclusion**: Airbnb hosts can significantly benefit from Swift's concerts by adjusting their pricing strategies. The study suggests a middle-range pricing model during concert dates to maximize bookings.

### Further Research (expand study)
- **Transportation Trends**: Examining transportation usage during concert dates could offer additional insights.
- **Cross-City Analysis**: Comparing data across different cities where Swift performs could help optimize pricing strategies for hosts with properties in multiple locations.
- **Restaurant Data**: Incorporating restaurant review data could provide a fuller picture of economic impacts during concert dates.

### Limitations
The main limitation is the availability of relevant data for comprehensive analysis across different locations and sectors.
