##Â Can Airbnb Hosts leverage Taylor Swift's Concerts to boost their Airbnb Revenue?

## Introduction

Many studies have already been published on the general impact that Taylor Swift has on the economy of a country when she performs a concert. However, few studies focus on her impact on specific businesses. 
This project dives into how her concerts affect Airbnb revenue, **particularly for hosts looking to optimize their pricing strategies.**

## Motivation

This project idea was born when **I was helping a relative set up their Airbnb Host account**. With everyone talking about the Eras Tour, I got curious about how Taylor Swift's presence could boost Airbnb revenue for my relative.

## Objective

The goal of this study is to give Airbnb Hosts insights into the best pricing strategies during major events like Taylor Swift's concerts. This can help hosts maximize their revenue and make smart pricing decisions.

## Key Findings

1. **Price Dynamics:** Airbnb prices jump by an average of 16.71% in neighborhoods where Taylor Swift fans stay during her concerts.
2. **Booking Preferences**: Entire homes/apartments are preferred during concerts, despite higher prices.
3. **Neighborhood Popularity**: Certain neighborhoods like Venice and Hollywood see more bookings during concert dates.


## Audience

This project is for Airbnb Hosts who want to understand how major events, like Taylor Swift concerts, can impact their pricing strategies and revenue. The insights here can help you adjust your prices to make the most of these events.

## Methodology

- **Data Collection:** We gathered data from different Airbnb listings in cities hosting Taylor Swift concerts.
- **Analysis:** We ran statistical analyses to find the average price increase and its consistency across neighborhoods.
- **Comparison:** We compared prices on concert dates versus non-concert dates to see the impact.




## Data Collection
The primary dataset is the Airbnb listings in Los Angeles, updated last in September 2023, relevant for our study surrounding Swift's August 2023 concerts. The dataset is available at [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/).

## Methodology
### Data Preparation
Data cleaning focuses on listings within Los Angeles close to the concert venue. We categorize the data into two sets: baseline listings for general trends and concert-specific listings for dates coinciding with Swift's concerts.

### Exploratory Analysis
Initial analysis involves comparing the number of bookings and types of rooms booked during baseline periods and concert dates. Key indicators include changes in room prices and types of accommodations preferred by concertgoers.

## Results

## Conclusion
Airbnb hosts can significantly benefit from Swift's concerts by adjusting their pricing strategies. The study suggests a middle-range pricing model during concert dates to maximize bookings.

## Further Research
- **Transportation Trends**: Examining transportation usage during concert dates could offer additional insights.
- **Cross-City Analysis**: Comparing data across different cities where Swift performs could help optimize pricing strategies for hosts with properties in multiple locations.
- **Restaurant Data**: Incorporating restaurant review data could provide a fuller picture of economic impacts during concert dates.

## Limitations
The main limitation is the availability of relevant data for comprehensive analysis across different locations and sectors.
